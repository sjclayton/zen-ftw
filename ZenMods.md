### Disable Rounded Corners

Does exactly what it says on the tin... disables the rounded corners of various
UI elements (including the main content view), recommended if you'd like a
slightly different look.

### No Sidebar Scrollbar

For those who don't like seeing scrollbars, this mod will assist in that quest.

Additionally, you can also try out this Firefox extension, [hide-scrollbars](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hide-scrollbars/)
to get rid of even more of them.

### Zen Context Menu

Very useful for quickly cleaning up unwanted / unused context menu items for a
cleaner, more Zen look.
